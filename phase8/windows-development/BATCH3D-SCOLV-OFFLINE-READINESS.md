# Batch 3D — Original native Windows `scolv` offline readiness

**Checkpoint prepared: 2026-11-01 — source/readiness only; NO `scolv` execution authorized.**

## Starting evidence and acceptance boundaries

- Original native Windows `scconfig` screenshot/exit code 0: PASS.
- Original native Windows `scrttv` offline local miniSEED screenshot/exit code 0: PASS, with NC/NGVB/EHZ trace visibly rendered. Historical test input SHA-256 and exact binary + Qt entrypoint integrity verified.
- Therefore **2 of 11** original GUI applications have actual first-window and clean-exit smoke evidence. Eleven entrypoints passed prior static packaging inspection, which is not runtime qualification.
- `scrttv` evidence `phase8/logs/batch3c-scrttv-gui/scrttv-20261101-092220.stdout.txt` and `scrttv-20261101-092220.qt-stderr.txt` has **not** yet been screened by the operator; diagnostic acceptance remains pending. Do not imply an error-free Qt log without reading it.
- The connected office workstation is not isolated: program-scoped ActiveStore block rule presence does **not** prove packet-level egress control, local loopback confinement, or helper-process containment.

## Prior `scolv` engineering baseline

From `phase8/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` P8-WINGUI-03A:

- Focused MSVC Release x64 original `scolv` build previously exited 0 after approved source change to `Seiscomp::Core::sleep(1)`; binary hash at that **historical staged build** was `4B310F845CCEC761F46D51527D1C37E3E95FE8DA26FCFC7EC90899EC4840F8CB`.
- That historical staging hash must **not** be presumed equal to the disposable R10 `bin/scolv.exe`. The R10 manifest provides the current identity.
- The previous source review recorded a `scolv --offline` path with local SCML `inventory-expanded.xml` and `config-expanded.xml` from `data/phase5b6/gfz2010avtm/inputs/`, plus `--inventory-db`, `--config-db` and `--input-file` options.
- Critically, **`--offline` alone does not unconditionally disable database access** in this source revision. An event input file is not yet selected or verified; first-window startup should not be conflated with event content or scientifically accurate locations.
- No `scolv` GUI, local XML loader, database operation or production messaging has been tested in this batch.

## Batch 3D-01 deliverable

Added read-only `Inspect-R10ScolvOfflineReadiness.ps1` to `phase8/windows-development/`.

- SHA-256 (ASCII source): `1ADFAE022431857B97680D823B5E3746FA54AA89ABC653AF2508092A7DEE502A` (8,054 bytes).
- Reads the verified disposable R10 856-entry manifest and receipt, validates `bin/scolv.exe`, `qt.conf`, `qwindows.dll`, and process-local environment helper hashes, and counts module-description XML files.
- Inspects both local SCML input filenames in **two known candidate workspace directories**. For existing regular files up to 50 MiB, returns actual size/SHA-256 and performs *well-formed XML only* streaming validation with DTD prohibited, external resolver disabled, 100 MiB parsed-character cap. It checks the document element name is `seiscomp`; it does not certify XML schema, epoch, responses, provenance or completeness.
- Inspects, **without modifying**, ActiveStore profile status and the exact named `SeisComP-R10Test-scolv.exe-OutboundBlock` rule scope for **only** the disposable `bin/scolv.exe`. Missing/mismatched rules are reported, not repaired.
- Explicitly reports `SCOLV_OFFLINE_EVENT_INPUT: NOT_SELECTED`, `SCOLV_GUI: NOT_RUN`, and the absence of traffic-level containment proof.
- Source was committed and read back, ASCII SHA-256 calculated, delimiter-balanced and manually screened for process execution/firewall mutations. **Actual Windows PowerShell parse and operator run have NOT been performed.**

## Next authorized work — separate from GUI runtime

1. Operator saves new source beside existing Phase 8 development scripts in the Y: workspace and verifies exact SHA-256 and `Parser.ParseFile` syntax. Per-file trust review only if permitted by IT policy; no PowerShell policy bypass.
2. Operator runs the **read-only** inspector on the disposable R10 and Y: workspace to report actual XML locations/hash and `scolv` firewall scope. A missing firewall rule should not be falsely reported as a verified block.
3. Source-level review must select an actual local event input, confirm `scolv` offline/database precedence, and design narrowly scoped child-process/egress boundaries before any launch. Avoid repeated checkpoints when previous hashes have passed.
4. Only a later, **new explicit `scolv`-specific authorization** may enable a non-elevated, one-session native Windows GUI test from the disposable R10 copy. The original `scconfig` and `scrttv` permissions do not extend to `scolv`.

**Current status: `BATCH3D_01_SCOLV_READINESS_SOURCE_READY / HOST_INPUT_CHECK_PENDING / SCOLV_GUI_NOT_RUN / NETWORK_AND_SCIENCE_NOT_QUALIFIED`.**
